# Modules Homepage

I'm organizing my code somewhat like how my dad organizes it - it's actually really smart! This folder is to store the view pages of the different view components. I originally put them all under a View folder.

Oh yeah btw the UiFramework folder helps me style things such as buttons, forms, etc.
