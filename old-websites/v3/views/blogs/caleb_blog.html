            <p class="header">The backstory:</p>
            <p class="text">
                A previous mystery solved a while ago was how Caleb used to always go downstairs and "play." Well, I
                wasn't stupid! I knew
                how he will always log off the computer when I went downstairs, and, out of curiosity, logged into his
                account
                and figured out that he was watching an excessive amount of minecraft videos.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                Snooping? No! He proudly admitted a while before that he had 'no secrets to hide' from anyone. That was
                why he didn't care
                that everyone in the family knew his password. It might feel wrong, I guess, to go onto his computer,
                but
                in a rational point of view, looking at his computer history was completely okay.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                I kept quiet. No need to be a douchebag and tell mom directly. Who needs to when you can test a person's
                brain functions
                and have fun? So I subtly (maybe not really) tested him around. Testing questions were like "Hey, what
                did
                you do downstairs?" Maybe not the subtlest, but I integraded those questions with slight accusations
                like:
                "Caleb, why are you doing all of your project this Sunday night? You had so much time to do it on
                Saturday!
                What were you doing?" Since I knew that he was spending all of his time on Youtube, it was more of a
                mocking
                question than a real one, though I doubt he knew that.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                I tried to do it when mom or someone was around so he can get more nervous and I can see what his
                reactions were. He will
                also be more forced to answer since he is the mommy's boy, not try to escape it. Mom would say, "yes,
                son,
                what were you doing?" and he will have to answer, lie, or escape the question with even more
                cunningness.
                He is actually not bad in lying, though. He will just makes himself look embarassed, look to the ground,
                and say something like: "Eh, I was
                <i>playing</i>." Since people will regard him as the "cute boy of the family," he can easily got away
                with things
                like this. Plus, he practically had the entire basement to himself, so the "playing" lie was not to
                badly
                put togather since mom would think that he was playing with the toys in the basement.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                No need to get angry. I was learning new things. I decided to try to 'accidentally' figure out that he
                was on Youtube. It
                worked once, where I saw him suspend the computer (linux term for sleep) with the minecraft video on it.
                Then I teased him a bitand made him really uncomfortable. I was
                <i>trying</i> to help him get off that "addiction," if you would, but it just kept going on, and he just
                became
                smarter. Smarter, but not smart enough.
            </p>

            <p class="text">
                I knew that he is conscious of this because he will always try to hide it. In a rational point of view,
                there is nothing
                wrong with watching Youtube videos. Caleb has a little work load, and if he has free time, he has all
                the
                right to watch people uselessly do gaming videos to waste his time. I watch Youtube, too. But when it
                gets
                into the way of homework and Kumon, it starts to become bad. Mom dissapproves of minecraft game
                watching,
                so, in that case, I can see why Caleb is scared.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                I remember when I used to watch Minecraft videos in the grade 4, 5 and 6 era. Maybe in the 5's the most.
                They were rather
                interesting, but it wore off and now I don't anymore! I guess that is sort of a big accomplishment.
            </p>
            <p class="header">The Present</p>
            <p class="text">
                Now he has found the shiny, high tech new invention called
                <i>incognito mode</i>. Whoa. He can browse with the searches not appearing on your search history! Well,
                that
                might of made his neocortex make the act of watching minecraft videos more morally pleasing, but it
                doesn't
                really change a thing. Oh yeah, it might of also decreased his stress since now people like me won't
                look
                at his search history and find minecraft videos being watched for 4 hours straight (I am pretty sure
                Caleb
                knows that I know that he watches minecraft videos extraneously). Now they will look and find nothing,
                even
                though he was downstairs for four hours! Of course evryone will think that he was playing with lego and
                tinkertoys
                for four hours each weekday! That new method is so inconspicuous, right guys? Of course that is!
                <br /> But to be honest, I think it is mainly the first reason since he might not have the every-present
                suspicion
                that someone will browse through his search history.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                He also got a lot more careful in running away to "play" before someone sees him watch minecraft videos.
                Before I heard dad
                a few times see Caleb watch the gaming vids, and would say "Oohh, always playing!" and probably annoy
                him.
                Since it wasn't mom, Caleb didn't take it really seriously, but he still took more precautions
                nevertheless.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                Now he suspending the computer far before anyone can walk down the stairs to see him. I remember the
                funny times when he
                was still learning, and I would see him jump &ndash; literally jump! &ndash; out of his seat to the
                place
                where all the toys were. They were around 2 meters away, but he had to turn his swivel chair around to
                be
                able to run there. It was funny to watch, since he was in such a paniced mode. Lol.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                Every since mom started working, coming home at 5 to 6 pm, he started to make sure he was always ready
                to cover up his video
                watching when he heard the garage door open &ndash; signalling that she was coming home. He would run
                upstairs
                and either say: "Hi mom!" or hide behind the basement door or corner after the garage door leading into
                the
                house to scare her. "Scaring" people was not new. He started...I actually don't know now. Two, three
                years
                ago? But all I know is that his boo's got really lame after a month of usage.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                He can hide the fact that he watches minecraft videos from mom, but he can't hide the fact that he
                sacrifices kumon time
                for Youtube. See, every week, on Thursday, we would go to the kumon center, exchange our six homework
                booklets,
                do some work there, and get six new kumon booklets from them. It was designed for us to do one booklet a
                day. Not bad. Well, there were times when Caleb will not do any Kumon until Tuesday. Good job, Caleb!
                <br />But this is serious. Mom even talked to him about finishing his kumon on time, and he still
                doesn't do it.
                Seriously, this is DEFCON 1! Caleb, not following what mom says? Men, prepare for imminent nuclear war.
                Just
                kidding.
            </p>
            <p class="header">The Case</p>
            <p class="text">
                Over the winter break, there were no kumon classes for two weeks. We got 20 worksheets then to do one
                every day over the
                break. I knew that Caleb was lagging behind tremendously on the tenth day or so, and lagging behind as
                in
                not having done a single booklet, so I decided to go and regularly check how his kumon was doing. On the
                13th day, mom found out, and made him do two every day. I would have liked him to cram it until the last
                day, since it would have been funny, but he didn't. He did enough everyday and got it finished. Or did
                he?
                The math obviusly did not work out, and I also checked his booklet on Wednesday, and he wasn't finished.
                I decided to wait until he went to the kumon center to get caught not finishing his kumon, but he came
                out
                unscathed. I was baffled. What happened there? I have never come to a kumon place with unfinished
                booklets,
                except for one time when I had questions about factorizing in about J50. That was excusable. Yes I was
                the
                good boy.
                <br /> I checked his booklet when he came back and there were the rest of his booklets. Okay, I know
                where they
                went.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                A few days later, though, those extra booklets were gone. He finished them? Impossible. I just knew that
                he didn't do that.
                So where did he put it? The recycle? Garbage? In his desk drawers? Nope. I was confused, but not
                frustrated.
                Maybe he put it in the recycle every Wednesday morning, when there is garbage day. He might have
                ingeniously
                put it somewhere, but I would be bound to find it.
            </p>
            <p class="header">Found</p>
            <p class="text">
                Under his chair cushion. A pretty stupid place to put it, if you ask me. I would have thought that he
                found a better place
                to hide/dispose his unuseful, not finished booklets, but nope. That is what happens when you
                procrastinate,
                I guess.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                On his chair, there is a small cusion that connects to the supports behind it. It is designed to make
                the chair more comfortable,
                which does work. It also serves as a sketchy place to hide your kumon booklets!
