        <h1 class="title">My Last Fix</h1>
        <h3 class="subtitle">TIME TO FIX THIS WEBSITE</h3>
        <p class="real-stuff">&nbsp; It has been over a month and I haven't done much to this website. I still don't
            know why the blog filter doesn't
            work and I really need to figure it out aH.</p>
        <p class="real-stuff">&nbsp; Looking at my code, all the links to the blog actually don't direct to the blog.
            They just run a javacript function
            which directs to the blog and then changes which blog posts to show. Maybe those links should direct to the
            blog, Maybe
            I should use a global variable (bad coding strategy but I don't care) which keeps the blog posts to show in
            (either WD,
            L4C, OT or All) so it'll be like an Elm union type but in strings cuz javascript doesn't support Union types
            rip. </p>
        <h3 class="subtitle">Phase 1</h3>
        <p class="real-stuff">&nbsp; So I changed the code so that clicking on a blog subsection - while you're in the
            blog - will filter through the
            posts. Not when you're outside of the blog page, though, probably because when the page redirects then the
            functions kinda
            die. Would the "global" varible even work, then?</p>
        <h3 class="subtitle">Phase 2</h3>
        <p class="real-stuff">&nbsp; Turns out it didn't work, but there's another solution that comes with
            <code>window.sessionStorage</code>. I can store a variable past a page reload! And it works now though it's
            really sketchy,
            cuz the page would flash a lot when you click directly to a blog tag from outside of the blog page.
            Whatever.</p>
        <h3 class="subtitle">Closing words</h3>
        <p class="real-stuff">&nbsp; Wow it's been a journey. I hope I can look back at this later and laugh - hopefully
            when I actually have a blog
            (made in Elm possibly haha). In any case I will not stop my pursuit of learning, but not forget where I have
            started off
            at - this very website.

        <p class="date">7/11/18</p>
        <h1 class="title">A good look back</h1>
        <p class="real-stuff">&nbsp; Wow, it has been 3 years since I've worked on this, and I would like to think that
            I have matured a lot. Of course,
            I dont code much in HTML, JS and CSS anymore. Right now, I am learning ELM and following a book called
            <a href="http://sarabander.github.io/sicp/" target="_blank">Structure and Interpretation of Computer
                Programs</a>. Wow my coding practises back then sure were...rachet. It really
            makes me laugh how much I valued stuffing everything in one file (lamo my javascript file called all.js) and
            how I put
            all my blog posts in one HTML file (like this one). Like holy cow it lags my editor when I scroll down lmao.
        </p>
        <h3 class="subtitle">Why?</h3>
        <p class="real-stuff">&nbsp; Ya idk man i think I was feeling nostalgic. I looked through my old websites
            because I wanted to see what I was
            able to do back then (at the end of Grade 7) and laugh at how bad it was. Surprisingly, it wasn't that bad,
            even though
            the aesthetics are very questionable. Of course, I had to change a lot of things, like change all the
            dependancies to
            cdnjs and make sure the anchor tags didn't point to links like
            <b>file:///home/joshua/coding-everything/Blog.html</b>. Ya the website didn't work at all when I first
            downloaded it from
            BitBucket lmao.
        </p>
        <h3 class="subtitle">But I'm not done!</h3>
        <p class="real-stuff">&nbsp; Sadly, this website isn't complete yet (to be put back on the shelf to be looked at
            later haha). The subcategories
            that the blog has doesn't work (idk why) and my code that deals with it in javascript is horrendous. And I
            have another
            blog site to revamp. Oh well. It'll be pretty fun, though.</p>

            <p class="real-stuff">&nbsp; Since Dad told me that coding everything from scratch is good, it is tiring and
                is not to the potential. With bootstrap,
                real pro coders actually make the code, so annoying things can be dealt with easier.</p>

        <h1 class="title">ParseInt() and parseFloat()</h3>
            <p class="real-stuff">&nbsp; In Javascript, when there are situations when you need to perform mathematical
                operations on a number you stored
                as a string,
                <code>parseInt()</code> and
                <code>parseFloat()</code> come in handy.</p>
            <h3 class="subtitle">ParseInt()</h3>
            <p class="real-stuff">&nbsp; This built-in function accepts a string and returns an integer (not a decimal).
                If the paremeter is a decimal,
                parseInt() will round the decimal down to the nearest whole number. Remember to put a string that only
                contains numbers.</p>
            <pre class="code"><code class = "JavaScript">var numString = "9001";
parseInt(numString);
//equal to 9001 (without quotes)

var decimal = "2.999999999999";
parseInt(decimal)//returns 2

var notNumString = "qwerty";
parseInt(notNumString);//will equal to NaN
</code></pre>
            <h3 class="subtitle">ParseFloat()</h3>
            <p class="real-stuff">&nbsp; This function is similar to parseInt() except it does not round the number. It
                will get rid of excess zero's, but
                other than that it returns a floating number.
                <br>&nbsp; Parsefloat will only return NaN if the first character at the least is not a number. if you
                type
                <code>parseFloat("80 year old grandpa")</code>, parseFloat will return
                <code>80</code>.</p>
            <pre class="code"><code class = "JavaScript">var numString = "20000.00000000000000000";
parseFloat(numString)//returns 20000

var decimal = "9.146293";
parseFloat(decimal)//returns 9.146293

var halfNumString = "I an 200000000 years old";
parseFloat(halfNumString)//will return NaN
</code></pre>
            <op class="real-stuff">&nbsp; Parsefloat() and parseInt() both do not recognize operation signs. Typing in
                <code>parseFloat("1*4")</code> onto the console will result in just
                <code>1</code>.</p>

            <p class="real-stuff">&nbsp; When making Identifier names, you will have to remember these four laws:</p>

                <li>
                    <p class="real-stuff">An Identifier must be at least one character in length.</p>

                <li>
                    <p class="real-stuff">The first character in an identifier must be a letter, an underscore, or a
                        dollar sign.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="real-stuff">Each character after the first letter can be a letter, an underscore, a dollar
                        sign, or a number.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="real-stuff">Spaces and special characters other than the underscore and the dollar sign
                        are not allowed in any part of the identifier.</p>

        <h1 class="title">Creating Constants</h3>
            <p class="real-stuff">&nbsp; Creating variables are pretty handy and useful to make, and well known. They
                can be changed by the console, but
                can is there a way to make a variable with a permanent value?</p>
            <h3 class="subtitle">Constants</h3>
            <p class="real-stuff">&nbsp; Constants are basically variables that cannot be modified once the script runs.
                After it is declared, the only
                way to change it is to edit the text editor itself. Constants use a "const" keyword and it is often
                named using all capital
                letters to make it stand out.</p>
            <pre rel="" class="code"><code class = "JavaScript">//Be careful when declaring constants-it is fairly new to Javascript and not all browsers support it
const ISJOSHUAAWESOME = true;
//can't change it now! :)
</code></pre>
            <p class="real-stuff">&nbsp; P.S., try typing
                <code>ISJOSHUAAWESOME</code> onto the console. If your browser supports the
                <code>const</code> keyword, you will know the truth!</p>

                idea what that means) which supposedly makes apps very easy to make.
                It uses fundemental HTML, CSS, and JS to make their mobile appliations. Dad said I should learn a bit

        <h1 class="title">Removing excess space in &lt;pre&gt; tags</h3>
            <p class="real-stuff">&nbsp; I have to disagree with my earlier blog post, saying to make insert a code
                block into the blog, you can follow
                this code:</p>
            <pre class="code"><code class = "html">&lt;!--html--&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;
    &lt;!--some code--&gt;
  &lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
</code></pre>
            <p class="real-stuff">&nbsp; Guess what will happen if you actually do that? The turnout will look like
                this:</p>
            <pre class="code">
	<code class = "html">
&lt;!--html--&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;
    &lt;!--some code--&gt;
  &lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
	</code>
</pre>
            <p class="real-stuff">&nbsp; See the extra space? &lt;pre&gt; tags displays the children elements with the
                <b>exact</b> spacing, so to remove all the space around and inside the &lt;pre&gt; tags, you will need
                to delete all extra
                space, so your code may look more like this:</p>
            <pre rel="" class="code"><code class = "html">&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;!--some code--&gt;
&lt;!--maybe some more code--&gt;

            <p class="real-stuff">&nbsp; It is just over one month since my blog post saying I was very lazy; not
                putting anything on the canvas section
                of my blog. Well, I finally finished a bit if it! I think it is all the canvas in the Javascript for
                kids book, and I
                will probably add in the last big project, a snake game, onto the website.
                <br> &nbsp; By the way, the canvas section takes up a lot of code. For the 14 snippets so far, my js
                code boosted from 188
                lines to 391 lines. Wow.</p>

        <h1 class="title">&amp;nbsp;'s AWESOME!</h3>
            <p class="real-stuff">&nbsp;Before I would never have thought of successfully making a paragraph indent
                before my blog post. Now, I still don't-but
                there's a space before the post, which mimics an indent. Since a paragraph (&para;) entity is too ugly,
                an "&amp;nbsp;"
                works out fine. It stands for "non-breaking space."</p>

        <h1 class="title">HTML Character Entitys</h3>
            <p class="real-stuff">&nbsp; To write certain characters in text form, character Entities will be needed.
                For example, lets say you need to
                make a &lt;p&gt; tag in the code section. If you type it in with the real tags, HTML will think you
                actually mean to
                write a paragraph, and it will not turn out as expected in the webpage.
                <br>&nbsp; &amp;lt; (remember the semicolin!) is the "&lt;" sign, and "&amp;gt;" is the "&gt;" sign, so
                to write a "p" tag
                as text, you will need to write &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;. So now writing an html skeleton may look like this:
            </p>
            <pre class="code"><code class = "html">&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;head&amp;lt;
  &amp;lt;/head&amp;lt;
  &amp;lt;body&amp;lt;
  &amp;lt;/body&amp;lt;
&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;
</code></pre>
            <p class="real-stuff">&nbsp;By the way, any character Entities in the Sublime text I'm using is purple. I
                think highlight.js just did not add
                it in yet.</p>

            <p class="real-stuff">&nbsp;This is so cool! Using something called
                <a href="https://highlightjs.org/" target="_blank">highlight.js</a>, it automatically highlights the
                text and makes it perfect when I just do:</p>
            <pre class="code"><code class = "html">&lt;!--html--&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;
    &lt;!--some code--&gt;
  &lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
</code></pre>
            <p class="real-stuff">&nbsp; Writing &lt; and &gt; in tags will make HTML think they are actual tags, you
                will need to write their Entity name
                or Entity number. A list of them can be found
                <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/charref" target="_blank">here</a>.

            <p class="real-stuff">&nbsp;I am so proud that I finished the blog filter. Now one can separately see blog
                posts made for the purpose of Website
                developments, my learning for coding, and other things worth mentioning. I also finished making the
                triangles as well
                as the dropdown for the blog a while back, so that is also an achievement for me. I want to make a
                search bar, as well
                as tags, so my blog filter may be ruined. oh well. Along with this. I am also planning to add things
                onto the home page
                of my website, as well as things on the the canvas I never added since the beginning.</p>

        <h1 class="title">Finished iRock</h3>
            <p class="real-stuff">&nbsp;A simple interactive Rock made with Javascript embedded into HTML is what I
                finished today. I also added a dividing
                line b/w the dropdown lists in the Snippets section. Cool!! :)</p>

        <h1 class="title">Started the Head first in Javascript Book</h3>
            <p class="real-stuff">&nbsp;I started the Head-first in Javascript book, and it started with a project; the
                iRock. Now I am trying to make another
                dropdown menu for the "Head first in Javascript" book for all the projects, but I need time.</p>

        <h1 class="title">Changing the blog</h3>
            <p class="real-stuff">&nbsp;To make the blog hopefully more professional, I am going to change the design.
                Here is the old blog.</p>
            <div class="blog-old1">
                <p class="dateX">-/-/-</p>
                <h1 class="title">blah</h3>
                    <p class="real-stuff">blah blah blah blah blah</p>
            </div>
            <p class="real-stuff">&nbsp;So I just changed the background colour and added the box shadow. Does it look
                good? I am having second thoughts,
                but maybe later.
                <br> Btw I am also starting the head-first in JavaScript book! Yay!</p>

        <h1 class="title">Start to read the new books</h3>
            <p class="real-stuff">&nbsp;So, I am too lazy to put the canvas on, maybe later, so I'm going to start to
                read the head first in HTML, JS, and
                CSS (two separate books). I really want to increase my knowledge, so that I can help dad on some coding
                things. And Dad
                also gave me a linux course, since I am using Linux on the once-windows computer.</p>

            <p class="real-stuff">&nbsp;Uh, so, it's been more than a week, but I forgot to make anything in the Canvas
                section. Oops. That's the problem
                of being me; I am very lazy. Lol.</p>

        <h1 class="title">Adding all snippets</h3>
            <p class="real-stuff">&nbsp;So, there's a load of things I learned from the Javascript for kids that is
                worth keeping, and I put in my windows
                8 tablet. Guess what? IT BROKE DOWN! THE HARDWARE CRASHED!!! I DIDN'T SAVE IT INTO BITBUCKET OR
                GITHUB!!! IT'S LOST!!!111!!!1111111
                Boo-hoo. Do I really have to restart? I'll try to stuff the important stuff in the snippet section, and
                I'll remember
                to save things in Bitbucket next time.</p>

                Javascript, But I'll need a database
                to store the info. Oh well. Maybe later.</p>
