                        Compared to my other blog, this website looks pretty good, and it was only made around 3 or so
                        weeks apart. Of course, i've
                        stopped working with AngularJs and Bootstrap, and started a functional programming language
                        called
                        <a href="http://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a> under the work of my dad. It's pretty good. I hope that
                        I'll be able to make a blog using
                        that language soon haha.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class='subtitle'>Looking both ways</h3>
                    <p class="text">
                        I've noticed that I have spent more and more time on making my blogs. The next blog I made, out
                        of angular 2 and bootstrap,
                        was pretty crazy and I only managed to make one or two blog posts on it. I can't even set it up
                        anymore
                        lmao cuz i forgot - I used routing so I have to create a localhost, and all my dependancies are
                        kinda
                        weird and outdated and idk it's confusing. I should try to get it to work though, for old times
                        sake.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text">
                        Hopefully I can get my Elm blog up and running soon. Like i have to learn a lot first, but it'll
                        be fun. Looking back on
                        this website gave me a lot of nostalgia, and hopefully I can look back on this later in life and
                        have a quick laugh. Like Wow my footer is so cringy lmao.

                        I don't even know why I made myself add another blog post to my old websites. I guess it's
                        mainly for the future me to see
                        what I was like when I was 16: my strange reflective tones. Damn but I should really get the
                        angular
                        2 website running - I had some lit stuff there. Well, see you in a few years, when I decide to
                        walk
                        down memory lane again. (I guess the only think I'm scared about is cdnjs somehow dying,
                        rendering
                        most of my dependancies unuseable rip. But I have faith.)

                        <i>like</i> Glyphicons, but it is...not like Glyphicons. Font-awesome uses SVG, scalable vector
                        graphics,
                        while Glyphicons uses something else. I do not know, but it still provides "sharp and clean
                        symbols".
                        <br>The thing I like about font-awesome is that it is free, and it has 585 fonts. Glyphicons
                        provides
                        limited fonts for free, and the rest is given if you pay. Glyphicons is growing in glyphs, as
                        well
                        as font-awesome. For now I will jump around, since the there are different icons in each,
                        sometimes.

                        and will not be obsolete (SVG will soon become very popular on the web!). Luckily we don't need
                        to
                        code much SVG, since XML knowlwdge will then be needed. Jquery, html, and maybe css are all you

                        Made with sass, this is a plugin that makes tooltips, like
                        <span class='simp simptip-position-top simptip-movable' data-tooltip='Cool, eh?'>This
                            one</span>. Here's some demos:
                        <br>
                        <span class='simp simptip-position-top simptip-smooth'
                            data-tooltip="Don't forget the rounded corners!">I have a tooltip on the top</span>
                        <br>
                        <span class="simp simptip-position-top half-arrow simptip-fade"
                            data-tooltip="There's also the half arrow and the fade effect!!">Tooltips can span all
                            directions; top, left, right, and bottom, but no corners.</span>
                        <br>
                        <span class="simp simptip-position-right simptip-multiline simptip-info"
                            data-tooltip="Long text can have the multilne class. This is an info tooltip">Tooltips can
                            come on colors; success as green, info as blue, warning as yellow, and danger as red.</span>

                        Made by
                        <a href='https://daneden.me/' target="_blank">Daniel Eden</a>, Animate.css is a plugin that
                        makes animations very easy. By adding a few classes,
                        <span>This boring text</span> can be turned into
                        <span class="animated infinite jello text">This text.</span>
                        <br> Did you know that the website title has it's own animation? Using simple javascipt,
                        clicking the
                        title makes it animate an animation called rubberBand

                        Basically AnguarJs is a huge function that adds a bunch of things in a pre-defined object called
                        $scope. "Why then is Angular
                        Js so helpful?", you may say. Well It has a lot of extra built-in things that makes html a lot
                        easier,
                        and there are also a bunch of things such as animations. (I still have yet to learn that)

                        will mess up the enire javascript. Joshua apologizes. Well, here is a responsive nyan cat

                        are not normally free, but the creator made it free for Bootstrap, which means free glyphs for

                        so as a thank you, we should link back to

                        Well, about time the blog has finished. I spend loads of time trying to get everything perfect,
                        especially including the
                        animations. Dad said that Angular JS provides a lot of easy animations to do, so I should learn
                        Angular
                        JS. Oh well. Sure.

                    Who wants to read text at the very bottom of the screen? No one! That's why I made a footer; to make

                    higher up the screen to ensure reading comfort and to make sure that no one will have a sore neck by
                    looking down all the time.
                    <br>It's not my fault if you have a sore neck reading
