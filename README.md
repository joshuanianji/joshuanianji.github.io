# My Website

The source code for my [website](joshuaji.com), written in Elm.

## Run Locally

We have to get routing to work as well, so I recommend running

`elm-live src/Main.elm --pushstate -- --output=elm.js` 

We use an output=elm.js as an parameter because I have the index.html file ready where I use javascript flags.
