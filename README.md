# My Website

The source code for my [website](joshuaji.com), written in Elm.

## Run Locally

Once you giut clone tor download the repository, run the following command in the directory folder. Elm-live will help with routing.

`elm-live src/Main.elm --pushstate -- --output=elm.js` 

We use an output=elm.js as an parameter because I have the index.html file ready where I use javascript flags.
