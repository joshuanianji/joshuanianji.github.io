# My Website

The source code for my [website](https://joshuaji.com/), a single page application written in Elm.

## Run Locally

Make sure you have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [elm](https://guide.elm-lang.org/install.html) and [elm-live](https://www.elm-live.com/) installed.

Once you git clone or download the repository, run the following command in the root folder.

`elm-live src/Main.elm --pushstate -- --debug --output=elm.js`

This will start a dev server on port 8000 - with a live reload!.
