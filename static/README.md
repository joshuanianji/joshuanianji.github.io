# Static files

I used to use this repo to only serve static files. Since I'm alo using it to host the source code of my website, I'm keeping the static files here for backward compatibility.

All the folders correspond to the directories in the website. For exmaple, `projects/atomic-models/index.html` correspond to [joshuaji.com/projects/atomic-models/](https://joshuaji.com/projects/atomic-models/).
