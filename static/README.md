# Static files

I used to use this repo to only serve static files. Since I'm also using it to host the source code of my website, I'm keeping the static files here for backward compatibility.

All the folders correspond to the directories in the website. For example, `projects/atomic-models/index.html` corresponds to [joshuaji.com/projects/atomic-models/](https://joshuaji.com/projects/atomic-models/).

## Improvements

It'll be nice to slowly delete these static files, and make each repo take care of uploading its code to Github Pages. Perhaps later...
